# Tacos

Tacos is a program that allows the user to log and store their favorite tacos. When the user inputs a taco the information is stored in a MySQL database and the taco information along with a "Down the Hatch" button are dynamically created on the page. If the user has tried that taco they can they click the button and the taco will be moved from the want to eat column to the devoured column.
